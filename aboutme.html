            <p>I am plant community ecologist broadly interested in how environmental variability and species invasions shape plant communities and how responses to past, current, and future variability can be understood through functional traits. Much of my work focuses on understanding these responses through the early life stages of seeds and seedlings in highly invaded temporally variable environments. My research integrates demography, experimental manipulations, long-term monitoring, and novel modeling techniques to understand these complex interactions.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am a L'Oréal For Women in Science Fellow in <a href = "https://gremerlab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/">Dr. Jennifer Gremer’s lab at UC Davis</a> and <a href = "https://hallettlab.netlify.app/">Dr. Lauren Hallett’s lab at the University of Oregon</a>. For my post-doc I am exploring trade-offs in seed dispersal and persistence in differentially variable environments utilizing seed traits, long-term datasets, and hidden Markov models. A large part of this project involves exploring these dynamics in invasive species in order to aid in management decisions. </p>
            <p>I completed my PhD at UC Davis in the Ecology Graduate Group under the guidance of Drs. <a href = "https://desp.ucdavis.edu/people/susan-p-harrison">Susan Harrison</a> and <a href = "https://latimer.ucdavis.edu/">Andrew Latimer</a>. My early research interests were inspired by the diverse strategies that plants have evolved in variable climates, especially seed dormancy and the ability to form seed banks. For my dissertation, I studied how interactions with invasive annual grasses affected native annual forb with variable resource acquisition strategies. </p>
            <p>I grew up in Southern California outside of LA and completed my undergraduate degree in International Studies & Economics at UC San Diego. My drive to understand environmentally sustainable development led me to uncover a passion for plants and ecology. </p>
