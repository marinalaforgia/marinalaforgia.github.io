            <p>I am plant population and community ecologist broadly interested in how functional traits can help us predict plant responses to interacting global change factors, like increasing precipitation variability and invasive species spread. Much of my work focuses on understanding these responses through the early life stages of seeds and seedlings in desert and grassland annuals.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow co-advised by Dr. Jennifer Gremer at UC Davis and Dr. Lauren Hallett at the University of Oregon. My research focuses on understanding the links between seed traits and demography to make better predictions of what types of species rely on seed banks and what types of species rely on dispersal.  Part of this project includes understanding these controls in invasive species with the goal of helping land managers better allocate limited resources when managing species with variable seedbanking strategies.</p>
            <p>I completed my PhD at UC Davis in the Ecology Graduate Group under the guidance of Drs. Susan Harrison and Andrew Latimer. My dissertation research focused on understanding native wildflower responses to invasive grasses and decreasing rainfall in California annual grasslands. Read more about this research here. </p>
            <p>I grew up in Southern California outside of LA and completed my undergraduate degree in International Studies & Economics at UC San Diego. My drive to understand environmentally sustainable development led me to uncover a passion for plants and ecology. </p>
