            <p>I am plant population and community ecologist broadly interested in how functional traits predict plant responses to interacting global change factors. Much of my work focuses on understanding these responses through the early life stages of seeds and seedlings in desert and grassland annuals. My research integrates demography, experimental manipulations, long-term datasets, and novel modeling techniques to understand these complex interactions.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Dr. Jennifer Gremer’s lab at UC Davis and Dr. Lauren Hallett’s lab at the University of Oregon. For my post-doc I am exploring seed trait trade-offs in arid and semi-arid annuals and whether these tradeoffs can predict demographic responses to the environment. A large part of this project is to improve our understanding of the seed bank dynamics of invasive annuals and how this information can be used to make better management decisions. </p>
            <p>I completed my PhD at UC Davis in the Ecology Graduate Group under the guidance of Drs. Susan Harrison and Andrew Latimer. My early research interests were inspired by the diverse strategies that plants have evolved in variable climates, especially seed dormancy and the ability to form seed banks. For my dissertation, I studied how interactions with invasive annual grasses affected native annual forb with variable resource acquisition strategies. </p>
            <p>I grew up in Southern California outside of LA and completed my undergraduate degree in International Studies & Economics at UC San Diego. My drive to understand environmentally sustainable development led me to uncover a passion for plants and ecology. </p>
