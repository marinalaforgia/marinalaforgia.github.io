From 2012-2015, California experienced one of the most extreme droughts in the last 10,000 years. Importantly, many annuals in California grasslands maintain seedbanks. To understand whether the seed banks are buffering these species during these drought years or whether the drought is surpassing the buffering limits of the seed bank, I sampled the soil seed bank before and after two years of extreme drought and compared belowground responses to those aboveground. I found that invasive annual grasses crashed both above and belowground, but native annual forbs increased in abundance in the seed bank. Further, those with low specific leaf area, a proxy for drought tolerance, increased in aboveground cover. This work was published in the journal Ecology.
