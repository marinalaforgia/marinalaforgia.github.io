Invasive species donâ€™t just compete with natives, they also change the very physical structure of the community in which they invade. In annual grassland communities, invasive annual grasses produce a large amount of standing biomass leading to a thick layer that has been shown to limit germination, establishment, and growth in native annual forbs. How this litter might act as a filter on the native community however remains unknown. I used a detailed demographic field study to understand how the effects of litter and live competition shifts the functional composition of native wildflower communities by differentially affecting resource acquisitive and resource conservative natives. I found that while invasive grasses only affect seed set in resource acquisitive natives, live grass combined with litter led to declines in both acquisitives and conservatives but with stronger declines in acquisitives. This suggests that invasive grasses have stronger effects on acquisitives, but that the presence of litter might be partially responsible for invader dominance over conservative natives. This work is in review at Biological Invasions.
