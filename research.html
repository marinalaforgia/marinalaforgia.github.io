								<p>I am currently conducting a USDA funded study to understand how seed traits can be used to predict seed banking strategy in a large suite of native and invasive plants across arid and semi-arid climatic regions. This project uses housed seed collections in botanic gardens and long-term datasets to predict how seed traits are linked with demography.</p>

								<p>Does competition between plants shift the rhizosphere microbiome? Do these shifts benefit the dominant competitor? These are questions I am exploring in collaboration with Dr. Cassie Ettinger, a microbial ecologist at UC Riverside.</p>
								<p>Rhizosphere microbiomes play an important role in plant health, stress tolerance, soil nutrition, and invasive species dominance. Still, relatively little is known about how these microbial communities are altered under plant competition, and even less about whether these shifts are tied to competitive outcomes between native and invasive plant species. We experimentally manipulated plant hosts and used high-throughput amplicon sequencing to look at rhizosphere structure and composition. We then assessed whether competitive responses of plant hosts were tied to differentially abundant bacterial and fungal families. </p>
								<p>We found that bacterial diversity and structure differed between invasive grasses and native forbs, but fungal diversity and structure did not. Bacterial community structures under competition were also distinct from both individual forb and grass bacterial community structures. We identified four bacterial families that varied in abundance between plants grown alone and in competition and that were significantly correlated with invasive grass dominance over native forbs. This work provides evidence that plant-rhizosphere interactions may impact plant competitive outcomes and that invader dominance over natives may be mediated by specific bacterial families.

								<p>Invasive species donâ€™t just compete with natives, they also change the very physical structure of the community in which they invade. In annual grassland communities, invasive annual grasses produce a large amount of standing biomass leading to a thick layer that has been shown to limit germination, establishment, and growth in native annual forbs. How this litter might act as a filter on the native community however remains unknown. I used a detailed demographic field study to understand how the effects of litter and live competition shifts the functional composition of native wildflower communities by differentially affecting resource acquisitive and resource conservative natives. I found that while invasive grasses only affect seed set in resource acquisitive natives, live grass combined with litter led to declines in both acquisitives and conservatives but with stronger declines in acquisitives. This suggests that invasive grasses have stronger effects on acquisitives, but that the presence of litter might be partially responsible for invader dominance over conservative natives. This paper is under review at Biological Invasions. </p>

					<h2>Interactive effects of Climate & Competition</h2>

								<p>Many native annuals in California are adapted to a variable climate through short lifespans and long-lived seedbanks. Competition with invaders however may be weakening their resilience to climate change. I manipulated rainfall and grass competition in an annual grassland and followed the demographic rates of six native annual forbs with variable resource acquisition strategies. I found that the presence of grass limited the capacity of all forbs to cope with climatic variability by making drought worse for resource acquisitive forbs through increased mortality and decreased seed set and by dampening the beneficial effects of watering on mortality in resource conservative forbs. This work was published in Ecology in 2020. </p>

								<p>From 2012-2015, California experienced one of the most extreme droughts in the last 10,000 years. Importantly, many annuals in California grasslands maintain seedbanks. To understand whether the seed banks are buffering these species during these drought years or whether the drought is surpassing the buffering limits of the seed bank, I sampled the soil seed bank before and after two years of extreme drought and compared belowground responses to those aboveground. I found that invasive annual grasses crashed both above and belowground, but native annual forbs increased in abundance in the seed bank. Further, those with low specific leaf area, a proxy for drought tolerance, increased in aboveground cover. This work was published in Ecology in 2018. </p>
