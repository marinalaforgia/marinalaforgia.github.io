								<p>I am currently conducting a USDA funded study to understand how seed traits can be used to predict seed banking strategy in a large suite of native and invasive plants across arid and semi-arid climatic regions. This project uses housed seed collections in botanic gardens and long-term datasets to predict how seed traits are linked with demography.</p>

					<h2>Rhizosphere Microbiomes and Competition</h2>

								<p>Does competition between plants shift the rhizosphere microbiome? Do these shifts benefit the dominant competitor? These are questions I am exploring in collaboration with Dr. Cassie Ettinger, a microbial ecologist at UC Riverside. Read a preprint of this study at BioRxiv.</p>
								<p>Rhizosphere microbiomes have received growing attention in recent years for their role in plant health, stress tolerance, soil nutrition, and invasive species dominance. Still, relatively little is known about how these microbial communities are altered under plant competition, and even less about whether these shifts are tied to competitive outcomes between native and invasive plant species. We investigated the structure and diversity of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal microbiomes of native annual forbs and invasive annual grasses individually and in competition using high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal ITS region. We assessed how significant shifts in key microbial families correlate to plant competitive responses through changes in biomass (log competitive response ratios). </p>
								<p>We found that bacterial diversity and structure differed between invasive grasses and native forbs, but fungal diversity and structure did not. Further, bacterial community structures under competition were distinct from both individual forb and grass bacterial community structures. We also identified four bacterial families (Burkholderiaceae, Methylophilaceae, Clostridiaceae_1, and Fibrobacteraceae) that showed variation in abundance between plants grown alone and in competition and that were significantly correlated with invasive grass dominance over native forbs. </p>
