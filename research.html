        <p> I am currently conducting a USDA funded study to understand how seed traits can be used to predict seed banking strategy in a large suite of native and invasive plants across arid and semi-arid climatic regions. This project uses housed seed collections in botanic gardens and long-term datasets to predict how seed traits are linked with demography.</p>
